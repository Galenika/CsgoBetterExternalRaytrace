# CsgoBetterExternalRaytrace
Overridden maps pack for better external raytrace

This pack of maps was made by me for more improved raytracing, 
all static props are no longer transparent for tracing, 
like most problem walls on most maps are no longer transparent.

It also includes more optimized raytracing code.
Raytracing speed is __10__ times faster than the original author code!

# How to use
 ## Opening bsp:
 You can store maps on disk, or download from this repository when this is needed.

# Notes
__1:__ Moving entities are still impossible to raytrace correctly!
Like opening doors or etc. (In principle, this is obvious for a variety of reasons that I will not mention here.)


__2:__ Some complex models or floors are not outlined very accurately, this is because both optimization and model complexity.

__3:__ In most cases, the walls at the borders of the maps are transparent.
This is done in the expectation (mostly because of optimization) that the player will not look from outside at the map, but will play inside it!


__4:__ If you need a map/maps, which is not here, I can make it for a small donation. My Discord: TheRioMiner#9902
